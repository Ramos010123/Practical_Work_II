            <h2> <b>Introduction</b> </h2>

            <p>Over the last few years, global trends in digitalization have been linked to a close relationship between the economy and technology. The crisis of 2008 sparked distrust in the traditional understanding of money. Alongside the development of information technologies, an alternative to conventional money was conceptualized and developed. The initial idea behind Bitcoin has evolved into a massive ecosystem of different decentralized blockchains, cryptocurrencies and tokens, creating numerous opportunities and challenges. After the 2019 pandemic, a rapid development of digital payment methods led to the appearance of new and fast forms of online payment.</p><br> <br>

            <h2><b>2- Cryptocurrencies</b> </h2>

            <p>Digital technology is at its peak, marking a shift from analog and electronic technology. Given this, it was inevitable that a digital form of currency would emerge. The study of cryptography, the conceptualization of the blockchain, and the 2008 economic crisis drove the creation of this digital currency, making Bitcoin a turning point in how we conceive money and the first example of what we now recognize as cryptocurrencies. Many companies and financial institutions are leveraging cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. These systems now control part of the economic transactions and are believed to be drastically transforming the way we do business.</p><br><br>

            <h2><b>2.1- Detailed overview</b> </h2> 

            <p>Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital assets with high transaction security due to advanced encryption. They rely on software that collects and stores money in a digital format sealed with end-to-end encryption. Cryptocurrencies are based on two concepts: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which allows easy access to synchronized data, and blockchain, a secure cryptographic structure. These currencies exist only virtually, using websites for transactions. What sets them apart is that both the sender and receiver must be knowledgeable and involved in the system for the currencies to have value.While their structure is complex, accessing them is relatively easy for anyone with internet access. </p><br> <br>

            <h2><b>2.2- Technologies involved</b> </h2>

            <p>To explain the technologies involved we are going to start by explaining the technologies on the surface to end with the most fundamental ones: blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms and the cryptography fundamentals behind cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies make use of blockchain technology. A blockchain consists of a database where transactions and other digital events executed by the participants are recorded. The blockchain works like an accountant’s ledger, registering all transactions between participants. For this reason, we categorize blockchain as being a DTL (Distributed Ledger Technology). It is distributed because the verification of blocks and transactions is executed by a large number of participants, ensuring decentralization. This is possible because blockchains work like P2P (Peer-to-peer) networks, where all nodes have the same privileges and functions. Regarding consensus, there are different mechanisms depending on the blockchain. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are two of the most well-known consensus mechanisms. PoW bases block verification on nodes proving they have used enough computing resources to solve a mathematical puzzle while PoS grants block verification randomly, with a higher chance of being chosen if you hold more tokens of the blockchain. Below consensus protocols, there is the foundational aspect of cryptocurrencies: cryptography. Cryptocurrencies are built upon cryptographic technology, including mathematical algorithms that generate public-private key pairs, which are the base for wallets where cryptocurrencies are stored. These are the hash functions that verify the integrity of the blocks of and elliptical curve encryption. Some blockchains like Ethereum include technologies like Smart Contracts, which allow participants to create self-executing contracts that perform an action automatically if a previously agreed condition is verified as true. Smart Contracts have led to technologies like NFTs, which verify ownership over certain digital goods.</p><br><br>

            <h2><b>2.3- Advantages and disadvantages</b> </h2> 

            <p>Cryptocurrencies offer an innovative alternative to traditional financial systems. They have advantages and disadvantages and can impact society in a way that can benefit or affect us. 

            The advantages of crypto are simple: secure digital currency. The main purpose of this is to make people's lives easier when handling money. First, it is decentralized and independent, meaning it operates without central authorities like banks or governments. Compared to the traditional system, crypto transactions tend to be low-cost or even free of charge for large amounts, reducing fees that generally banks charge, plus these cheap transactions can be sent or received worldwide, making them very helpful. It uses blockchain technology, which offers transaction security and protects users' personal information.

            Cryptocurrencies also face significant disadvantages. One major drawback is the high volatility. Also, the lack of regulations in many countries has exposed companies and individuals to cyberattacks, frauds and other illegal actions. Many companies that mine cryptocurrencies use energy, raising environmental concerns due to carbon emissions.</p>

            <h2><b>2.4- Evaluation of cryptocurrencies and their potential evolution </b> </h2>

            <p>Everyday tons of coins are created, and their prices change constantly. Each coin has a project behind it and social media news which will make a place in the market for the coins, in order to get a better acceptance into the society. Right now, lots of coins are accepted and used. The used coins are stablecoins. For usability of coins, for example they are used to make payments between two users, publicly and anonymously by encrypting the wallet of each one. However, cryptocurrencies have many other uses.</p><br> 

            <b>-Security and regulation: </b><br> 

            <p>Nowadays crypto is secure if people know how to manage it. Experts, for example, are hardly ever affected by thieves attacking and trying to steal their cryptocurrencies, since they use protocols like using off-line storage solutions like hardware wallets, or researching in depth about the exchange you are about to do to make sure it is safe to minimize the risk of losing their investments. It has a wide projection because crypto has a decentralization that makes a volatile market and the possibility of getting scammed.  To sum up, cryptocurrencies are partially a safe way to keep money.</p><br>

            <b>-Acceptance:</b><br> 

            <p>Several companies have pushed forward campaigns to promote such exchanges. Nonetheless, it was only recently when neobanks brought up the idea of a card with which you can operate using your cryptocurrencies.

            Whilst cryptocurrencies are not fully integrated in today’s society, it is true that it has gained lots of recognition, and it has become more common to see people trading with these currencies.</p><br>

            <b>-Use:</b><br>

            <p>With the appearance of new cryptos and new projects, up until now the use has completely changed. Current uses are: 

            Making investments by holding them over long periods of time regardless of the volatility.  

            Staking is another investment method based on locking any amount of cryptos for any amount of time in order to obtain a certain interest.  

            Promoting projects by gifting coins in the known airdrops.  

            Using a specific coin for small contracts and applications (ETH case) or simply to connect IoT and services. 

            These are many examples of the uses of cryptocurrencies and others will be created following people’s needs and project requirements.

            Cryptocurrencies have come a long way and what started with Bitcoin is now a massive number of different cryptocurrencies, blockchains, tokens and innovations.

            What we can be sure about is that blockchain technology will find its own purpose and CBDCs, a variation of cryptocurrencies that is explained further down in the ethics section, will probably be used by public entities sooner or later. 

            However, the path for Bitcoin, Ethereum and other conventional cryptocurrencies is still unclear, although data suggests that a slow acceptance of this technology is taking place, and the bear market that took place in 2023 had little to no effect in the way cryptocurrencies are seen as a technology with potential to change things for better.

            Some of the evolutions we can expect in the future are: potential evolution of cryptocurrencies encompasses the further development of new consensus protocols like Proof of History, new blockchains with new features and tokens, new technologies that allow for a greater acceptance, cryptocurrencies as an accepted payment method, new legal regulations regarding this currencies, the CBDCs and brand new integrations with AI in the near future and with quantum computing in the long term and stronger cryptographic algorithm.</p><br> 

            <h2><b>2.5- Ethical analysis </b> </h2>

            <p>When evaluating the ethics of cryptocurrencies we find that the main debate lies, but in the possible uses that this digital currency has and would get. 

            Our analysis wants to address whether the difference in ethical vs unethical use cases of cryptocurrencies is enough to justify a future expansion in the use.

            The analysis, we are going to evaluate the effect on the  economy and political aspects of society, the positive and negative externalities and, whether cryptocurrencies have a responsibility in the facilitation of illegal activity or not. 

            Regarding the political and economic debate, the moral downside that cryptocurrencies face is that, The lack of regulation means that cryptocurrencies value can fluctuate widely.

            However, we must state that this wouldn’t be such a challenge in the case of the adoption of one form of cryptocurrency as the main form of currency, which is similar to the dollar right now. 

            It´s necessary to find  consensus mechanisms for volatility and offer regulation could be developed, imitating the mechanisms that stand behind the way stable coins, 

            Not only that, the political part of the debate, cryptocurrencies allow a more transparent way of understanding, creating a system in which the states transactions with public funds get all written in an immutable and transparent blockchain network that citizens can check in order to know how their taxes are being used, making it difficult for politicians to make use of public funds in corrupt ways. 

            Moreover, if a decentralized currency system was installed, it would reduce the control that governments can have over money, putting obstacles in the way for the development of authoritarian regimes, representing a big upside in terms of achievable liberty. 

            Cryptocurrencies, face a big ethical challenge with the pollution externality, fruit of the massive use of energy .

            Our position regarding this debate is that, although it is a problem now, further development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the near future will come with effective solutions that have low energy consumption while achieving the level of security and decentralization that the Proof of Work consensus protocol achieves. 

            Last but not least, we proceed to evaluate the ethics of cryptocurrencies regarding the facilitation of illegal activity such as money laundering, tax evasion, terrorism financing or commerce of illegal goods and services, among other illegal activities. 

            For this reason, in our opinion, the ethical debate regarding cryptocurrencies lies in this factor. However, we do not consider this ethical downside to be enough to support a mass prohibition of the use of these kinds of currencies. We believe that, if with further development and adoption of this technology this ethical problem is acknowledged, new innovative solutions that reduce or even make illegal use of these currencies disappear will eventually appear. However, we must point out that, if illegal use of cryptocurrencies keeps expanding and no solutions to the problem arise, cryptocurrency supporters might have to change the approach regarding pseudonymity in this form of digital currency, possibly having to give up this security aspect in exchange for the vanishing of illegal use. 

            In conclusion, the development of cryptocurrencies is already solving some of the unethical downsides regarding the political and economic situation and the management of negative externalities. Thus, the ethical weak point of cryptocurrencies lies in its use as an illegal payment method, an ethical challenge yet to be addressed that holds by itself the morality of cryptocurrencies. </p><br>

            <h2><b>Conclusions</b></h2> 

            To conclude, cryptocurrencies are the result of a series of previously developed technologies that have given birth to the form of digital money that could have been expected from the transition to a digital world. Cryptocurrencies have several advantages and disadvantages as has been underlined, however, we must consider that this technology is still evolving and getting integrated into our regulated and centralized economy, finding its place and new possible usages, while bearing in mind the moral implications. We are yet to find the place for cryptocurrencies in our economy, but we are pretty sure that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.

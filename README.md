Description of my work:
I have just finished my practical work, and I can say it was such a complex task, mainly because you could complicate yourself as much as you wanted.
At the beginning, I read the information provided and decided to focus first on creating the website, so I could store the code. When I finished, I uploaded all the information to GitHub, just as we did for Activity iii, but now, instead of using the provided code, I used my own.
Firstly, I created all the folders following the given structure. After , I opened my VS Code and started developing my website. The first thing I did was to create the main div, which I used across all the pages. I also created the header, the nav, and the footer, where I linked my social media platforms, as well as my LinkedIn and GitHub accounts. The first HTML file I made was the index. At the beginning, I worked really slowly, but as time went by, I began to pick up speed. It was easy to create the index, so I tried to add extra features to learn new things. Nevertheless, since I had no clear ideas, I started searching for information and asking ChatGPT how to implement the ideas that were emerging in my head. I made sure to ask for explanations to ensure I understood how to do those things.
I continued developing the HTML files, and as I was unsure of what to do, I spent some time browsing Google to gather ideas.When I decided what to include, I searched for how to implement those features and kept trying until I achieved the expected results. I followed this method throughout the project.
One of the ideas I had was to create a form, so I watched a video on YouTube and followed the steps. In the end, I linked all the pages to each other where necessary and reviewed all the CSS. Now, I am writing this DDD and about to upload everything to GitHub.

Problems during the development:
At the beginning, I didn’t encounter major problems—well, only the ones I deliberately created to improve my work. As the project progressed, I started facing more and more issues. The last day I had planned to work on this website ended up being much longer than expected.
Troubles began in the morning. I had planned to finish everything before lunch, but because of the issues, I ended up working until night. The main problem was that when I made a change, the entire website broke down—everything shifted, the links stopped working, and the images didn’t fit properly. I got really stressed. Honestly, I don’t know what happened, but it took me hours to fix it. Luckily, I managed to solve the issue, but it was incredibly time-consuming. Or so I thought—because at that moment, I realized my href to the FCE.html wasn’t working.
When I was about to lose my mind, I asked ChatGPT what my mistake was, and it responded that everything looked fine and should work. That only made me fill frustrated. Finally, I realized that one line of code had been moved, I removed to the correct place and everything got fixed. I wont lie, this got me on my nerves because the code was so long and I was looking and trying things, but no results were coming. 

Conclusion:
Despite all the challenges, this was one of the first times I genuinely enjoyed working on a project. I found it interesting and useful, as well as challenging, because you can create whatever you’re able to imagine. Now I have a packed calendar with many tasks to complete, but web development is something I will try to pursue whenever I have free time. I’ll do my best to improve my skills.
